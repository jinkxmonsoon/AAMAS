## Entries
- 2026-05-13 (UTC): Initialized repository structure for protocol traceability. Deferred all empirical implementation.
- 2026-05-13 (UTC):
  - Technical result: Hardened repository scaffold with full governance/config/data/results/notebooks directory checks in `scripts/validate_repo.py`; added placeholder packaging and protocol validator entrypoint.
  - Scientific result: No empirical findings produced; this update only increases protocol traceability and reproducibility readiness.
  - Intentionally not implemented: experiments, metrics computations, baseline logic, dataset ingestion/modification, and any result generation.
  - Remaining risk: Protocol placeholders are still uninstantiated; unauthorized future edits to locked concepts remain a governance risk if review discipline is not enforced.
- 2026-05-13 (UTC):
  - Technical result: Removed duplicate module files (`src/cctdiag/io.py`, `src/cctdiag/schema.py`), kept package-based structure, and added ambiguity detection in `scripts/validate_repo.py` to fail when both module and package exist for protected names.
  - Scientific result: No empirical findings produced; update only reduces import ambiguity risk and improves maintainability for protocol-first development.
  - Intentionally not implemented: experiments, datasets, metric computations, baselines, and any empirical reporting outputs.
  - Remaining risk: Placeholder-only package boundaries are now clean, but concrete API contracts across subpackages remain undefined until protocol-approved implementation starts.
